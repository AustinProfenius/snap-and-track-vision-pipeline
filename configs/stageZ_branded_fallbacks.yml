# StageZ Branded Fallback Configuration
#
# Deterministic branded FDC entries for foods that don't exist in Foundation/SR databases.
# Used when Stage1b/1c/2 fail (empty pool or all rejected) and class-intent matches target classes.
#
# This prevents stage0_no_candidates for common foods that only exist as branded items:
# - Cherry tomatoes, grape tomatoes: No Foundation/SR entries
# - Broccoli florets: Only generic "broccoli" in Foundation/SR
# - Scrambled eggs: Only "Fast foods egg scrambled" (sr_legacy, rejected by Stage2)
# - Green beans: Only baby food and veggie mixes in Foundation/SR
#
# Structure:
#   <normalized_key>:
#     primary:
#       brand: "<Brand Name>"  # For telemetry (from FDC brand_name field)
#       fdc_id: <FDC ID>       # REQUIRED: Branded food FDC ID
#       kcal_per_100g: [min, max]  # Plausibility guard range
#     alternates:
#       - { brand: "<Brand>", fdc_id: <ID>, kcal_per_100g: [min, max] }
#
# Canonical keys are normalized forms (lowercase, singular via whitelist, no descriptors).
# The resolver will try multiple normalized forms (e.g., "cherry tomato" / "cherry_tomato").
