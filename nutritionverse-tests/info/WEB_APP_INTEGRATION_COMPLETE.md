# Web App Integration for Phase 1 Stage 5 Proxy Alignment - COMPLETE ✅

**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Date**: 2025-10-26
**Scope**: Web app integration with full Phase 1 validation UI

---

## 🎯 Implementation Summary

All requested features from the user's integration plan have been implemented:

### ✅ 1. Banner & Flag Status Display (Startup)
**File**: `nutritionverse_app.py` (lines 570-573, 587-622)

**What was added**:
- `print_alignment_banner()` called on app initialization to console
- Printed once per session (tracked in `st.session_state.banner_printed`)
- Banner shows feature flag status, version, timestamp

**Console output**:
```
======================================================================
FDC ALIGNMENT ENGINE - BATCH RUN
======================================================================
Timestamp: 2025-10-26T...
Version: 5-Stage + Stage-5 Proxy (v2.1)

Feature Flags:
  prefer_raw_foundation_convert: True
  enable_proxy_alignment: True
  stageZ_branded_fallback: True
  vision_mass_only: True
  strict_cooked_exact_gate: True
======================================================================
```

### ✅ 2. Feature Flag UI Controls (Sidebar)
**File**: `nutritionverse_app.py` (lines 587-622)

**What was added**:
- Collapsible "Feature Flags (Alignment Engine)" expander in sidebar
- Interactive checkboxes for 3 key Phase 1 flags:
  1. **Prefer Raw Foundation + Conversion** (default: True)
  2. **Enable Stage 5 Proxy Alignment** (default: True)
  3. **Strict Cooked Exact Gate** (default: True)
- Updates `FLAGS` object in real-time when toggled
- Shows current status summary at bottom of expander
- Warning: "⚠️ Changes apply to NEW alignments only"

**User experience**:
```
🚩 Feature Flags (Alignment Engine)
⚠️ Changes apply to NEW alignments only

☑ Prefer Raw Foundation + Conversion
☑ Enable Stage 5 Proxy Alignment
☑ Strict Cooked Exact Gate

─────────────────
Current Status:
✓ Stage 5: Active
✓ Conversion: Preferred
✓ Stage 1 Gate: Strict
```

### ✅ 3. DB Reconnect Helper
**File**: `src/adapters/fdc_database.py` (lines 49-81)

**What was added**:
- `reconnect()` method - Closes existing connection and establishes new one
- `is_connected()` method - Health check with simple SELECT 1 query
- Useful for chunked batch processing with retry logic

**Usage**:
```python
db = FDCDatabase()

try:
    foods = db.search_foods("chicken")
except psycopg2.OperationalError:
    db.reconnect()
    foods = db.search_foods("chicken")

# Or check health first
if not db.is_connected():
    db.reconnect()
```

### ✅ 4. Phase 1 Validation Report Card
**File**: `nutritionverse_app.py` (lines 41-47 imports, 1063-1139 display)

**What was added**:
- Imported `validate_telemetry_schema()` and `compute_telemetry_stats()` from eval_aggregator
- Added "🎯 Phase 1 Alignment Validation" section after batch summary statistics
- Extracts telemetry from all successful batch results
- Validates telemetry schema (fails fast on "unknown" stages/methods)
- Computes and displays Phase 1 acceptance criteria:
  1. **Schema Validation**: ✅/❌ All items have valid telemetry (no unknowns)
  2. **Conversion Rates**: ✅/❌ Eligible rate ≥50% (with overall vs eligible breakdown)
  3. **Stage 5 Whitelist**: ✅/❌ No violations (shows count of Stage 5 items)
  4. **Stage Distribution**: Top 5 stages with counts and percentages
- Expandable "Detailed Telemetry Stats" JSON view

**Example output**:
```
🎯 Phase 1 Alignment Validation

1. Schema Validation                    3. Stage 5 Whitelist
✅ PASS: All items have valid telemetry  ✅ PASS: No whitelist violations (7 Stage 5 items)

2. Conversion Rates                     4. Stage Distribution
✅ PASS: Eligible rate 64.4% ≥50%        stage2_raw_convert: 62 (62.0%)
Overall: 62.0% (62/100)                  stage3_branded_cooked: 24 (24.0%)
Eligible: 64.4% (62/96)                  stage5_proxy_alignment: 7 (7.0%)
                                         stage4_branded_energy: 5 (5.0%)
                                         stage1_cooked_exact: 2 (2.0%)

### ✅ 5. Validation Utilities Integration
**Files Modified**:
- `nutritionverse_app.py` - Added imports for eval_aggregator functions
- `tools/eval_aggregator.py` - Already had all necessary functions

**Functions integrated**:
- `validate_telemetry_schema(items)` - Hard-fails on missing/unknown fields
- `compute_telemetry_stats(items)` - Returns comprehensive telemetry breakdown including:
  - Conversion rates (overall vs eligible)
  - Stage distribution
  - Method distribution
  - Stage 5 count and whitelist violations
  - Gates (sodium, negative vocab, Stage 1 raw Foundation blocks)

## 📁 Files Modified

| File | Lines Changed | Purpose |
|------|---------------|---------|
| `nutritionverse_app.py` | +110 lines | Banner, flags UI, Phase 1 report card |
| `src/adapters/fdc_database.py` | +32 lines | Reconnect and health check methods |

**Total**: ~142 lines of new code

## 🎓 Key Features

### Banner Printing
- Automatically prints alignment configuration to console on app startup
- Shows feature flags, version, timestamp
- Helps debug alignment behavior in production

### Interactive Feature Flags
- Users can toggle Phase 1 alignment behavior from UI
- No need to edit .env or restart app
- Changes apply immediately to new alignments
- Preserves existing alignment results in session

### Phase 1 Validation Report Card
- **Schema Validation**: Ensures no "unknown" stages/methods leak through
- **Dual Conversion Rates**: Shows both overall (62%) and eligible (64.4%) conversion rates
  - Eligible rate = conversion rate among items with raw Foundation candidates
  - Overall rate = conversion rate among all items
- **Stage 5 Whitelist Enforcement**: Validates proxy usage against whitelist keywords
- **Stage Distribution**: Visual breakdown of which stages are being used
- **Pass/Fail Indicators**: Clear ✅/❌ for each criterion

### DB Reconnect Helper
- Enables chunked processing with automatic retry on connection drop
- Health check method for preemptive reconnection
- Useful for long-running batch evaluations (459+ images)

## 🚀 Usage

### Launching the Web App
```bash
cd nutritionverse-tests
streamlit run nutritionverse_app.py
```

### Testing Phase 1 Integration

**Single Image Test**:
1. Open web app
2. Select an image with mixed salad greens, yellow squash, or tofu
3. Click "🚀 Run Prediction"
4. Check "🗄️ View Database Alignment Details" for Stage 5 proxy usage

**Batch Test with Phase 1 Validation**:
1. Open web app
2. Go to sidebar → "Advanced Filters"
3. Set "Max items" to 6 (for Phase 1 criteria)
4. Select "Batch Test" mode
5. Choose range (e.g., "First 100")
6. Click "🚀 Run Batch Test (100 images)"
7. Wait for completion
8. Review "🎯 Phase 1 Alignment Validation" section

**Expected results**:
- ✅ Schema validation passes (no unknowns)
- ✅ Eligible conversion rate ≥50%
- ✅ Stage 5 whitelist violations = 0
- Stage distribution shows mix of Stage 2 (dominant), Stage 3, Stage 5, etc.

### Toggling Feature Flags

**Disable Stage 5 to test fallback behavior**:
1. Sidebar → "🚩 Feature Flags (Alignment Engine)"
2. Uncheck "Enable Stage 5 Proxy Alignment"
3. Run new prediction
4. Stage 5 items should now use Stage Z or Stage 4 instead

**Disable conversion preference to increase Stage 1 usage**:
1. Uncheck "Prefer Raw Foundation + Conversion"
2. Run new prediction
3. Stage 1 (cooked exact) usage should increase
