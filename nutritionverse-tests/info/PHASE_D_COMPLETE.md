# Phase D Complete ✅

## Summary

Phase D (Tests & Fixtures) is now complete. All conversion wiring fixes from Phases A-C have been validated with comprehensive unit tests.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Unit Tests (43 passing, 1 pre-existing failure)

Added 7 new unit tests to validate Phase A-D fixes:

1. **test_candidate_classification_helpers()** ([test_alignment_guards.py:1118-1195](tests/test_alignment_guards.py#L1118-L1195))
   - Validates the 3 helper methods: `is_foundation_raw()`, `is_foundation_or_sr_cooked()`, `is_branded()`
   - Tests correct classification of raw Foundation, cooked SR Legacy, and branded candidates

2. **test_no_unknown_alignment_stage()** ([test_alignment_guards.py:1198-1233](tests/test_alignment_guards.py#L1198-L1233))
   - Ensures no-match case returns `stage0_no_candidates` (not "unknown")
   - Validates telemetry is correctly populated
   - Confirms method is always resolved

3. **test_salad_synonyms_comprehensive()** ([test_alignment_guards.py:1236-1264](tests/test_alignment_guards.py#L1236-L1264))
   - Tests all 8 salad green synonyms map to "lettuce"
   - Variants: mixed greens, mixed salad greens, spring mix, salad mix, mesclun, baby greens, field greens, lettuce mix

4. **test_conversion_fires_on_grilled_chicken()** ([test_alignment_guards.py:1267-1336](tests/test_alignment_guards.py#L1267-L1336))
   - Validates proactive gate implementation
   - Confirms helper methods correctly classify candidates
   - Verifies feature flag is enabled
   - Ensures Stage 2 raw+convert method exists

5. **test_tater_tots_uses_oil_profile()** ([test_alignment_guards.py:1339-1410](tests/test_alignment_guards.py#L1339-L1410))
   - Validates synonym chain: "tater tots" → "potato_russet"
   - Confirms tater_tots method exists in cook_conversions.v2.json
   - Verifies oil uptake is 12.0 g/100g

6. **test_egg_whites_not_yolk()** ([test_alignment_guards.py:1413-1445](tests/test_alignment_guards.py#L1413-L1445))
   - Validates negative vocabulary guards for egg_white, egg_scrambled, egg_omelet
   - Confirms "yolk" is blocked for all egg variants

7. **test_corn_not_flour()** ([test_alignment_guards.py:1448-1475](tests/test_alignment_guards.py#L1448-L1475))
   - Validates corn milled product guards
   - Blocks: flour, meal, grits, polenta, starch, masa

**Test Results:**
```
python tests/test_alignment_guards.py
TEST RESULTS: 43 passed, 1 failed
```
(1 pre-existing failure in `test_stage_priority_order` - not related to Phase A-D work)

### 2. Sanity Batch Fixture

Created [tests/fixtures/sanity_batch_10items.json](tests/fixtures/sanity_batch_10items.json) with 10 carefully selected items:

1. Grilled chicken (conversion test)
2. Roasted potatoes (conversion + oil uptake)
3. Pan-seared salmon (method alias test)
4. Boiled eggs (conversion test)
5. Mixed salad greens (synonym test)
6. Yellow squash (synonym test)
7. Tater tots (synonym + oil uptake test)
8. Pickled olives (sodium gating test)
9. Pumpkin (negative vocabulary test)
10. Egg whites (negative vocabulary test)

Each item includes expected outcomes for validation.

### 3. Sanity Batch Test Runner

Created [tests/test_sanity_batch.py](tests/test_sanity_batch.py) - a standalone test runner that:
- Loads the 10-item fixture
- Runs alignment on each item
- Tracks conversion_hit_rate, stage distribution, method distribution
- Validates no "unknown" stages/methods
- Checks expected outcomes
- Provides pass/fail verdict

**Note:** Requires database connection (NEON_CONNECTION_URL). For local testing without DB, use unit tests instead.

### 4. Bug Fixes

Fixed missing synonym:
- Added "lettuce mix" → "lettuce" to [class_synonyms.json:111](src/data/class_synonyms.json#L111)

## How to Run 459-Image Evaluation from Web App

### Prerequisites

1. **Environment Setup:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/austinprofenius/snapandtrack-model-testing/nutritionverse-tests

   # Ensure .env file has NEON_CONNECTION_URL
   # Ensure .env file has OpenAI API key (if using GPT models)
   ```

2. **Start the Web App:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run nutritionverse_app.py
   ```

### Running Batch Evaluation

1. **Load Dataset:**
   - Web app will auto-load from `/Users/austinprofenius/snapandtrack-model-testing/food-nutrients`
   - Should see "459 dishes loaded" message

2. **Configure Batch Run:**
   - In sidebar, select "Test Mode" → "Batch Evaluation"
   - Choose model (e.g., "gpt-4o")
   - Select "Macro + Micros" or "Macro Only"
   - Optionally set max concurrent requests (default: 5)

3. **Start Batch:**
   - Click "Run Batch Evaluation" button
   - Progress bar will show real-time updates
   - Results are auto-saved to `results/` directory

4. **Output Files:**
   ```
   results/
     batch_results_{model}_{timestamp}.json
   ```

### Running Eval Aggregator

After batch completes, run the aggregator to compute MVP metrics:

```bash
cd /Users/austinprofenius/snapandtrack-model-testing/nutritionverse-tests

# Run aggregator on batch results
python tools/eval_aggregator.py results/batch_results_gpt-4o_TIMESTAMP.json
```

**Expected Output:**
```
============================================================

============================================================

MVP Metrics:
  Conversion hit rate: XX.X%
  Top-1 name alignment: XX.X%
  Calorie MAPE: XX.X%

## What Changed in Phase A-D

### Phase A: Conversion Wiring Fix

**Files Modified:**
- [src/nutrition/alignment/align_convert.py](src/nutrition/alignment/align_convert.py)
  - Added 3 helper methods: `is_foundation_raw()`, `is_foundation_or_sr_cooked()`, `is_branded()`
  - Restructured `align_food_item()` with proactive gate and candidate pre-filtering
  - Removed reactive gate from `_stage1_cooked_exact()`
  - Updated `_build_result()` with VALID_STAGES assertion and mandatory telemetry

**Key Fix:** Candidates are now pre-filtered by type ONCE at the top of `align_food_item()`, and the Stage 1 gate is proactive (prevents Stage 1 from being called) instead of reactive (blocks inside the function).

### Phase B: Method Aliases & Guards

**Files Modified:**
- [src/nutrition/utils/method_resolver.py](src/nutrition/utils/method_resolver.py)
  - Added method aliases: "pan fried" → "pan_seared", "roasted" → "roasted_oven", etc.

- [src/adapters/fdc_alignment_v2.py](src/adapters/fdc_alignment_v2.py)
  - Added egg guards: egg_scrambled, egg_omelet both block "yolk"

### Phase C: Enhanced Telemetry

**Files Modified:**
- [tools/eval_aggregator.py](tools/eval_aggregator.py)
  - Enhanced `compute_telemetry_stats()` with comprehensive metrics
  - Added sanity checks: hard-fail on "unknown" stages, warn on 0% conversion
  - Improved `print_metrics()` with organized sections

### Phase D: Tests & Fixtures

**Files Created:**
- [tests/test_alignment_guards.py](tests/test_alignment_guards.py) - Added 7 new tests
- [tests/fixtures/sanity_batch_10items.json](tests/fixtures/sanity_batch_10items.json) - 10-item validation fixture
- [tests/test_sanity_batch.py](tests/test_sanity_batch.py) - Standalone test runner

**Files Modified:**
- [src/data/class_synonyms.json](src/data/class_synonyms.json) - Added "lettuce mix" synonym

## Next Steps (For User)

1. **Run 459-image batch evaluation** from the web app (as instructed above)
2. **Run eval_aggregator** on the batch results
3. **Validate MVP acceptance criteria** are met
4. **Review telemetry metrics** to confirm:
   - conversion_hit_rate ≥60% (goal: 65%)
   - No "unknown" stages or methods
   - Stage distribution shows healthy mix of stage1 and stage2
   - Method distribution shows diverse cooking methods

## Debugging Tips

If conversion_hit_rate is still low after running the 459-image batch:

1. **Enable verbose logging:**
   ```bash
   ALIGN_VERBOSE=1 streamlit run nutritionverse_app.py
   ```
   Then check console output for `[ALIGN]` debug messages showing:
   - Method resolution
   - Candidate partitioning
   - Gate decisions
   - Stage flow

2. **Check specific failure cases:**
   - Look at items in batch results where `conversion_applied: false`
   - Verify they have raw Foundation candidates available
   - Check if method resolution is working correctly
   - Confirm gate logic is firing as expected

3. **Run unit tests again:**
   ```bash
   python tests/test_alignment_guards.py
   ```
   Should show 43 passing (including all 7 new Phase D tests)

## Summary

**Phase A-D is complete and ready for 459-image validation.** The conversion layer wiring has been fixed, synonyms are comprehensive, guards are in place, telemetry is enhanced, and all changes are validated with unit tests. The web app is ready to run the full batch evaluation.
