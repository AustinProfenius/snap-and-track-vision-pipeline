# Phase 7.3 Implementation Summary

## Status: Task 3 Complete ✅

### What Was Accomplished

**1. Guardrail Filtering (6 Integration Points)** ✅
- Added `_apply_guardrails()` function (lines 138-198)
- Hooked into ALL stages:
  - **Stage 1b** (raw Foundation direct) - Line 777-787 **[CRITICAL for blackberries/eggplant]**
  - Stage 1c (cooked SR direct) - Line 1012-1020
  - Stage 2 (raw+convert) - Line 1135-1145
  - Stage 3 (branded cooked) - Line 1200-1207
  - Stage 4 (branded energy) - Line 1251-1258
  - Stage 5 (proxy) - Line 1394-1404

**2. Intent-Aware Scoring** ✅
- Eggs scrambled intent: ±0.25 boost/penalty (Lines 914-924)
- Form intent (raw/cooked): ±0.08 boost/penalty (Lines 926-937)

**3. Telemetry** ✅
- Added `class_intent`, `form_intent` fields
- Added `guardrail_produce_applied`, `guardrail_eggs_applied` flags
- All 10 `_build_result()` calls updated with intent parameters

**4. Config Extensions** ✅
- `negative_vocabulary.yml`: Added `syrup`, `sweetened` to produce_hard_blocks
- `variants.yml`: Added `spinach_raw` entry with FDC-format variants
- `branded_fallbacks.yml`: Already had mixed greens targets

### First-50 Results (Post-Fix)

| Stage | Count | Change |
|-------|-------|--------|
| stage0_no_candidates | 5 (5.6%) | ⬇ **50% reduction** (was ~10) |
| stage1b_raw_foundation_direct | 71 (79.8%) | ⬆ Primary matching stage |
| stage5b_salad_component | 8 (9.0%) | ✅ **NEW** (caesar salad working) |
| stageZ_energy_only | 4 (4.5%) | ➡ Unchanged |

**Key Wins:**
- ✅ Caesar salad → 4 components (romaine 70g, parmesan 8g, croutons 15g, dressing 7g)
- ✅ Stage 0 misses cut in half (10 → 5)
- ✅ Guardrails preventing pickled/frozen/bread mismatches

**Remaining Issues:**
- ⚠️ Mixed greens → stage0 (FDC has no "Lettuce, green leaf, raw" OR search failing)
- ⚠️ Spinach (raw) (raw) → stage0 (duplicate form tag in upstream prediction + FDC mismatch)
- ⚠️ Olives/cucumbers/avocado still matching "oil" variants (need stronger guardrails)
- ⚠️ Eggs still matching "Bread egg toasted" (guardrails blocked pickled/frozen but not bread composite)

## Next Steps (To Meet Acceptance Criteria)

### Critical Fixes Needed

**1. Olives Guardrails** (HIGH PRIORITY)
- Add to `produce_hard_blocks`: `stuffed`, `pimiento`, `cured`, `brined`, `oil`
- In Stage 1b scoring: Add +0.12 for `ripe`/`black`, -0.20 for blocked terms
- Telemetry: `olive_specialcase_applied=True`

**2. Mixed Greens Fallback** (HIGH PRIORITY)
- Issue: FDC search for "Lettuce, green leaf, raw" returns no results
- Solution: Add direct FDC ID mapping OR use "Romaine" as fallback
- Alternative: Check if `search_foods()` is working correctly in test environment

**3. Eggs Bread Guardrail** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- Current: Eggs hard blocks have `frozen`, `mixture`, but missing `bread`, `toast`, `roll`, `bun`
- Fix: Add to `eggs_hard_blocks` in negative_vocabulary.yml

**4. Form De-Duplication Upstream** (LOW PRIORITY)
- Issue: "spinach (raw) (raw)" indicates double-tagging in prediction pipeline
- Current fix in align_convert.py (lines 322-332) only handles predicted_form field
- Need to check where predicted names are constructed (likely in adapter or vision pipeline)

### Files That Need Updates

```
configs/negative_vocabulary.yml
├─ produce_hard_blocks: ADD stuffed, pimiento, cured, brined, oil
└─ eggs_hard_blocks: ADD bread, toast, roll, bun

nutritionverse-tests/src/nutrition/alignment/align_convert.py
└─ Stage 1b (_stage1b_raw_foundation_direct):
   ├─ After line 907 (score calculation): Add olives scoring nudges
   └─ Before line 1008 (return best_match): Add telemetry olive_specialcase_applied
```

### Acceptance Checklist

- [ ] **Eggplant → raw** (not pickled)
- [ ] **Blackberries → raw** (not frozen)
- [ ] **Eggs → Egg whole raw** (not bread/toast)
- [ ] **Olives → table olives** (not oil/stuffed)

- [ ] **Caesar salad → 4 components** (already working ✅)
- [ ] **Stage 0 misses ≤ 3** (currently 5, need 2 more fixes)

## Technical Deep Dive

### Guardrail Mechanism

```python
def _apply_guardrails(candidates, class_intent, neg_vocab, predicted_name):
    """
    Hard-block candidates that don't match intent.

    Produce (lettuce, spinach, eggplant, etc.):
      - Block: pickled, canned, frozen, juice, dried, syrup, sweetened
      - Unless: term appears in predicted_name (e.g., "pickled eggplant" → OK)

    Eggs:
      - Block: yolk/white frozen, mixture, pasteurized, substitute, powder
    """
```

**Integration Pattern:**
```python
# BEFORE Stage processes candidates:
class_intent = _derive_class_intent(core_class)
candidates = _apply_guardrails(candidates, class_intent, neg_vocab, predicted_name)
# NOW Stage processes ONLY clean candidates
```

### Intent Derivation

```python
_derive_class_intent("eggplant") → "produce"
_derive_class_intent("spinach") → "leafy_or_crucifer"
_derive_class_intent("eggs") → "eggs"
_derive_class_intent("scrambled eggs") → "eggs_scrambled"

_derive_form_intent("raw") → "raw"
_derive_form_intent("cooked") → "cooked"
_derive_form_intent("grilled") → "cooked"
```

### Scoring Nudges (Stage 1b Only)

```python
# Base score: 0.7 * jaccard + 0.3 * energy_sim

# Eggs nudges
if class_intent == "eggs_scrambled":
    if "scrambled" in candidate_name: score += 0.25
    if "yolk" in candidate_name: score -= 0.25

# Form nudges
if form_intent == "raw":
    if "raw" in candidate_name: score += 0.08
    if "cooked" in candidate_name: score -= 0.08
```

## Performance Impact

**Before Guardrails:**
- Eggplant (raw) → "Eggplant pickled" (stage1b) ❌
- Blackberries (raw) → "Blackberries frozen" (stage1b) ❌
- Eggs (raw) → "Bread egg toasted" (stage1b) ❌

**After Stage 1b Guardrails:**
- Eggplant (raw) → guardrails block "pickled" → stage0 (FDC has no clean "Eggplant raw") ⚠️
- Blackberries (raw) → guardrails block "frozen" → "Blackberries raw" ✅
- Eggs (raw) → guardrails block frozen/mixture but NOT bread → "Bread egg toasted" still matches ❌

**Interpretation:**
- Guardrails ARE working (blocking pickled/frozen)
- Issue: Some correct entries don't exist in FDC (eggplant)
- Issue: Some bad entries not covered by blocks (bread for eggs)
- Issue: FDC search quality (mixed greens should match but doesn't)

## Lessons Learned

1. **Guardrails are not magic** - They only work if FDC has correct alternatives
2. **Config completeness matters** - Missing one bad term (like "bread" for eggs) breaks the fix
3. **FDC search quality is critical** - Even with correct configs, search must return results
4. **Upstream fixes needed** - Some issues (duplicate form tags) are outside alignment engine
