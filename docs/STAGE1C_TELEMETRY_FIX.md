# Stage 1c Telemetry Fix: Persistence to telemetry.jsonl

## Problem

The `stage1c_switched` telemetry field was being printed to stdout but NOT persisted to `telemetry.jsonl`. This meant that Stage 1c raw-first preference switches (e.g., "Bread egg toasted" → "Egg whole raw fresh") were visible in logs but not queryable in telemetry files.

### Evidence

```bash
# stdout showed switches:
[TELEMETRY] stage1c_switched: {'from': 'eggplant pickled', 'to': 'eggplant raw'}
[TELEMETRY] stage1c_switched: {'from': 'blackberries frozen unsweetened', 'to': 'blackberries raw'}

# But telemetry.jsonl had zero entries:
$ grep -ic '"stage1c_switched"' runs/<timestamp>/telemetry.jsonl
0
```

## Root Cause

The `TelemetryEvent` schema in `pipeline/schemas.py` did not include the `stage1c_switched` field, so it was being silently dropped during JSONL serialization.

## Solution

Added `stage1c_switched` field to the `TelemetryEvent` schema and wired it through the telemetry pipeline.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Schema Update (`pipeline/schemas.py`)

Added new optional field to `TelemetryEvent`:

```python
class TelemetryEvent(BaseModel):
    # ... existing fields ...

    # Phase 7.4: Stage 1c raw-first preference tracking
    stage1c_switched: Optional[Dict[str, str]] = None  # {"from": "original_name", "to": "new_name"}

    # ... version tracking ...
```

#### 2. Telemetry Extraction (`pipeline/run.py`)

Added extraction and validation of `stage1c_switched` from telemetry dict:

```python
# Phase 7.4: Extract stage1c_switched if present
stage1c_switched = telemetry.get("stage1c_switched")
# Ensure it's a dict with "from" and "to" keys, or None
if stage1c_switched and isinstance(stage1c_switched, dict):
    if "from" not in stage1c_switched or "to" not in stage1c_switched:
        stage1c_switched = None
else:
    stage1c_switched = None

telemetry_event = TelemetryEvent(
    # ... existing fields ...
    stage1c_switched=stage1c_switched,
    # ... rest of fields ...
)
```

## Verification

### Unit Tests

Created `pipeline/tests/test_stage1c_telemetry_persistence.py` with 4 tests:

1. ✅ Schema includes `stage1c_switched` field
2. ✅ Field is optional (None when no switch)
3. ✅ JSONL format (single-line JSON)
4. ✅ Dict validation ({"from": str, "to": str})

```bash
$ python pipeline/tests/test_stage1c_telemetry_persistence.py
Running stage1c_switched telemetry persistence tests...

✓ test_telemetry_event_schema_includes_stage1c_switched passed
✓ test_telemetry_event_stage1c_switched_optional passed
✓ test_jsonl_line_format passed
✓ test_stage1c_switched_dict_validation passed

======================================================================
✅ All tests passed!
======================================================================
```

### Integration Test

Created `test_stage1c_telemetry.py` which runs alignment pipeline and verifies telemetry:

```bash
$ python test_stage1c_telemetry.py
Running alignment...
[TELEMETRY] stage1c_switched: {'from': 'blackberries frozen unsweetened', 'to': 'blackberries raw'}

✓ Found telemetry file: runs/20251029_101619/telemetry.jsonl

✓ Found stage1c_switched for 'blackberries':
    from: blackberries frozen unsweetened
    to: blackberries raw

======================================================================
TELEMETRY ANALYSIS
======================================================================
Total telemetry events: 3
Events with stage1c_switched: 1

✅ SUCCESS: stage1c_switched is being persisted to telemetry.jsonl!
```

### JSONL Content Verification

```bash
$ find . -name "telemetry.jsonl" | head -1 | xargs cat | grep stage1c_switched | python -m json.tool
```

Example output:

```json

  "image_id": "test_stage1c_telemetry",
  "food_idx": 1,
  "query": "blackberries",
  "alignment_stage": "stage1b_raw_foundation_direct",

## Telemetry Schema

### `stage1c_switched` Field

**Type**: `Optional[Dict[str, str]]`

**Description**: Captures when Stage 1c raw-first preference switches a processed food match to a raw alternative.

**Structure**:
```json
{
  "from": "original_matched_name",
  "to": "new_raw_alternative_name"
}
```

**Examples**:

| Food | From (Processed) | To (Raw) |
|------|-----------------|---------|
| eggs | bread egg toasted | egg whole raw fresh |
| blackberries | blackberries frozen unsweetened | blackberries raw |
| avocado | oil avocado | avocados raw florida |
| eggplant | eggplant pickled | eggplant raw |

**When Null**: Field is `null` when:
- Food didn't go through Stage 1b (different alignment stage)
- Stage 1b match was already raw (no switch needed)
- No raw alternative was available

## Querying Telemetry

### Count Stage 1c Switches

```bash
grep -c '"stage1c_switched":' runs/<timestamp>/telemetry.jsonl
```

### Extract All Switches

```bash
grep '"stage1c_switched":' runs/<timestamp>/telemetry.jsonl | \
  python -m json.tool | \
  grep -A3 '"stage1c_switched"'
```

### Find Specific Food Switches

```bash
grep '"query":"eggs"' runs/<timestamp>/telemetry.jsonl | \
  grep '"stage1c_switched"' | \
  python -m json.tool
```

### Aggregate Switch Patterns

```python
import json
from pathlib import Path
from collections import Counter

telemetry_file = Path("runs/<timestamp>/telemetry.jsonl")
switches = []

with open(telemetry_file) as f:
    for line in f:
        event = json.loads(line)
        if event.get("stage1c_switched"):
            switches.append((
                event["query"],
                event["stage1c_switched"]["from"],
                event["stage1c_switched"]["to"]
            ))

# Most common switches
print("Most common switches:")
for (food, from_name, to_name), count in Counter(switches).most_common(10):
    print(f"  {food}: {from_name} → {to_name} ({count}x)")
```

## Impact
