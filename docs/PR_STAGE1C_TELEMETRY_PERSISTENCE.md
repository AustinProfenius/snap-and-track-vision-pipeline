# PR: Fix stage1c_switched Telemetry Persistence to JSONL

## Summary

Fixes critical bug where `stage1c_switched` telemetry was printed to stdout but NOT persisted to `telemetry.jsonl`. This prevented analysis and monitoring of Stage 1c raw-first preference switches in production.

## Problem

Stage 1c raw-first preference successfully switches processed foods to raw alternatives (e.g., "Bread egg toasted" → "Egg whole raw fresh"), and these switches are logged to stdout:

```
[TELEMETRY] stage1c_switched: {'from': 'blackberries frozen unsweetened', 'to': 'blackberries raw'}
```

However, the `stage1c_switched` field was not being persisted to `telemetry.jsonl`:

```bash
$ grep -ic '"stage1c_switched"' runs/<timestamp>/telemetry.jsonl
0  # ❌ Zero entries!
```

This meant switches were visible in logs but not queryable in telemetry files, preventing production observability.

## Root Cause

The `TelemetryEvent` schema (`pipeline/schemas.py`) was missing the `stage1c_switched` field, so it was silently dropped during JSONL serialization.

## Changes Made

### 1. Schema Update

**File**: `pipeline/schemas.py` (line 139)

Added `stage1c_switched` field to `TelemetryEvent`:

```python
class TelemetryEvent(BaseModel):
    # ... existing fields ...

    # Phase 7.4: Stage 1c raw-first preference tracking
    stage1c_switched: Optional[Dict[str, str]] = None  # {"from": "original_name", "to": "new_name"}

    # Version tracking (mandatory)
    code_git_sha: str
    config_version: str
    fdc_index_version: str
    config_source: str = "external"
```

### 2. Telemetry Extraction

**File**: `pipeline/run.py` (lines 195-240)

Extract and validate `stage1c_switched` from telemetry dict:

```python
# Phase 7.4: Extract stage1c_switched if present
stage1c_switched = telemetry.get("stage1c_switched")
# Ensure it's a dict with "from" and "to" keys, or None
if stage1c_switched and isinstance(stage1c_switched, dict):
    if "from" not in stage1c_switched or "to" not in stage1c_switched:
        stage1c_switched = None
else:
    stage1c_switched = None

telemetry_event = TelemetryEvent(
    # ... existing fields ...
    stage1c_switched=stage1c_switched,
    # ... rest of fields ...
)
```

### 3. Unit Tests

**File**: `pipeline/tests/test_stage1c_telemetry_persistence.py` (new, 152 lines)

4 comprehensive tests:
1. Schema includes `stage1c_switched` field
2. Field is optional (None when no switch)
3. JSONL format (single-line JSON)
4. Dict validation ({"from": str, "to": str})

### 4. Integration Test

**File**: `test_stage1c_telemetry.py` (new, 117 lines)

End-to-end test that:
- Runs alignment pipeline with foods that trigger switches
- Verifies telemetry.jsonl exists and contains `stage1c_switched`
- Validates JSON structure

## Verification

### Unit Tests ✅

```bash
$ python pipeline/tests/test_stage1c_telemetry_persistence.py
Running stage1c_switched telemetry persistence tests...

✓ test_telemetry_event_schema_includes_stage1c_switched passed
✓ test_telemetry_event_stage1c_switched_optional passed
✓ test_jsonl_line_format passed
✓ test_stage1c_switched_dict_validation passed

======================================================================
✅ All tests passed!
======================================================================
```

### Integration Test ✅

```bash
$ python test_stage1c_telemetry.py
[TELEMETRY] stage1c_switched: {'from': 'blackberries frozen unsweetened', 'to': 'blackberries raw'}

✓ Found telemetry file: runs/20251029_101619/telemetry.jsonl

✓ Found stage1c_switched for 'blackberries':
    from: blackberries frozen unsweetened
    to: blackberries raw

======================================================================
TELEMETRY ANALYSIS
======================================================================
Total telemetry events: 3
Events with stage1c_switched: 1

✅ SUCCESS: stage1c_switched is being persisted to telemetry.jsonl!
```

### JSONL Content ✅

```json
{
  "image_id": "test_stage1c_telemetry",
  "food_idx": 1,
  "query": "blackberries",
  "alignment_stage": "stage1b_raw_foundation_direct",
  "fdc_id": 173946,
  "fdc_name": "Blackberries raw",
  "stage1c_switched": {
    "from": "blackberries frozen unsweetened",
    "to": "blackberries raw"
  },
  "code_git_sha": "289c6a477419"
}
```

## Impact

### Before

- ❌ `stage1c_switched` only in stdout (ephemeral)
- ❌ No persistence to `telemetry.jsonl`
- ❌ Cannot query or analyze switches
- ❌ No production observability

### After

- ✅ `stage1c_switched` persisted to `telemetry.jsonl`
- ✅ Full JSONL schema support
- ✅ Queryable via grep/jq/python
- ✅ Production observability enabled
- ✅ Zero performance overhead
- ✅ Unit tests ensure correctness

## Telemetry Schema

### `stage1c_switched` Field

**Type**: `Optional[Dict[str, str]]`

**Structure**:
```json
{
  "from": "original_matched_name",
  "to": "new_raw_alternative_name"
}
```

**When Present**: Stage 1c switched a processed match to a raw alternative

**When Null**: No switch occurred (already raw, different stage, or no alternative available)

**Example Switches**:

| Food | From (Processed) | To (Raw) |
|------|-----------------|---------|
| eggs | bread egg toasted | egg whole raw fresh |
| blackberries | blackberries frozen unsweetened | blackberries raw |
| avocado | oil avocado | avocados raw florida |
| eggplant | eggplant pickled | eggplant raw |

## Query Examples

### Count Switches

```bash
grep -c '"stage1c_switched":' runs/<timestamp>/telemetry.jsonl
```

### Extract All Switches

```bash
grep '"stage1c_switched":' runs/<timestamp>/telemetry.jsonl | python -m json.tool
```

### Find Specific Food

```bash
grep '"query":"eggs"' runs/<timestamp>/telemetry.jsonl | grep '"stage1c_switched"' | python -m json.tool
```
