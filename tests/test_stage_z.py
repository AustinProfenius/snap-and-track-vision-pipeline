"""
Unit tests for Stage Z - Universal Branded Last-Resort Fallback.

Tests validate that Stage Z:
1. Only runs when all previous stages (1-4) fail
2. Fills catalog gaps (bell pepper, herbs, uncommon produce)
3. Applies strict quality gates to prevent misalignments
4. Uses synonym expansion for better token matching
5. Tracks comprehensive telemetry
6. Applies maximum confidence penalty (-0.50)

Test Cases:
1. Green bell pepper (raw) → finds single-ingredient branded, 20-35 kcal
2. Bacon → rejects meatless/turkey, accepts real pork bacon
3. Raisins → rejects cookies/bars, accepts single-ingredient dried
4. Rice (boiled) → accepts only if 110-170 kcal, ingredients=rice+water
5. Chicken breast (plain) → rejects breaded (carb gate + processing)
6. Multi-ingredient allowed → chicken salad passes with valid ingredient list
7. Forbidden terms → "seasoned marinated" rejected
8. Score floor → candidate with score 2.3 rejected (< 2.4)
