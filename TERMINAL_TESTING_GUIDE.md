# Terminal Testing Guide

## Problem Solved: DB Connection from Terminal ‚úÖ

The original issue was that Python path setup and .env loading weren't working when running tests from terminal (outside the web app context).

### Solution: Use `run_tests.sh` Wrapper

We created a wrapper script that handles all environment setup:

```bash
./run_tests.sh [test_name]
```

**Available tests:**
- `quick` - Quick validation (6 key foods)
- `diagnostic` - DB connection diagnostic
- `unit` or `pytest` - Run unit tests
- `50batch` - Run first 50 dishes batch test
- `help` - Show usage

### What the Wrapper Does

1. **Sets PYTHONPATH**:
   ```bash
   export PYTHONPATH="$REPO_ROOT/nutritionverse-tests:$REPO_ROOT/pipeline:$PYTHONPATH"
   ```

2. **Loads .env file**:
   ```bash
   export $(cat "$REPO_ROOT/.env" | grep -v '^#' | xargs)
   ```

3. **Enables pipeline mode**:
   ```bash
   export PIPELINE_MODE=true  # Fail-fast on config errors
   ```

4. **Runs the test** with correct working directory and paths

```

**Config Version:** `configs@a65cd030a277`

## Issues Found & Analysis

### 1. Apple ‚Üí Croissants (Dessert Leakage) ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Status:** P1 penalty implemented but NOT working

**Root Cause:** The produce class-conditional penalty we added (line 1130-1140 of align_convert.py) requires:
```python
if class_intent in ["produce", "leafy_or_crucifer"]:
```

**Problem:** The `class_intent` for "apple" might not be set to "produce". Let me check the `_derive_class_intent()` function mapping.

**Fix Needed:** Ensure apple maps to `class_intent="produce"` so penalty applies.

---

### 2. Scrambled Eggs ‚Üí stage0 ‚úó

**Status:** Variants added, method extraction added, but still failing

**Log shows:**
```
Query variant matched: 'scrambled eggs' ‚Üí 'egg scrambled' (1 candidates, 1 Foundation/SR)
‚úó No match
```

**Analysis:** The variant IS matching and returning 1 candidate, but Stage1b/Stage2 are rejecting it. This suggests:
- Stage1b scoring threshold too high, OR
- Stage2 conversion failing

**Debug Needed:** Run with `ALIGN_VERBOSE=1` to see scoring details.

---

### 3. Cherry Tomatoes ‚Üí stage0 ‚úó

**Status:** Variants added to `variants.yml` but not being used

**Log shows:**
```
No FDC candidates found (tried variants)
```

**Problem:** The variants we added (`cherry_tomatoes:`) might not be getting matched to the query "cherry tomatoes". The variant system might require exact key match.

**Fix Needed:** Check how `generate_query_variants()` maps queries to variant keys in `variants.yml`.

---

### 4. Broccoli Florets ‚Üí stage0 ‚úó

**Status:** Same as cherry tomatoes - variants added but not being used

**Problem:** `broccoli_florets:` key in `variants.yml` not matching query "broccoli florets".

## Why Terminal Testing Wasn't Working Before

### The Import Chain

When running from terminal:
```
run_first_50_by_dish_id.py
  ‚îî‚îÄ> imports AlignmentEngineAdapter
       ‚îî‚îÄ> tries to import config_loader from pipeline/
            ‚îî‚îÄ> FAILS: pipeline/ not in sys.path
```

### The .env Loading Issue

```python
# alignment_adapter.py line 40
load_dotenv(override=True)  # Looks for .env in current working directory
```

When running from `gpt5-context-delivery/entrypoints/`, it looks for `.env` there (doesn't exist) instead of repo root.

### Why Web App Works

The web app (Streamlit) runs from repo root and has its own Python path setup, so:
- Working directory = repo root
- `.env` file found at `./env`
- Imports work via Streamlit's module system

---

## Next Steps to Fix Remaining Issues

### Priority 1: Fix Apple ‚Üí Croissants Leakage

```bash
# Check class_intent derivation
grep -n "def _derive_class_intent" nutritionverse-tests/src/nutrition/alignment/align_convert.py
```

Need to ensure "apple" maps to `class_intent="produce"`.

### Priority 2: Debug Scrambled Eggs Scoring

```bash
# Run with verbose logging
ALIGN_VERBOSE=1 ./run_tests.sh quick 2>&1 | grep -A20 "scrambled eggs"
```

This will show:
- Stage1b scores, thresholds
- Why candidates are being rejected
- If Stage2 conversion is even attempted

### Priority 3: Fix Variant Matching for Cherry Tomatoes

The issue is likely in `generate_query_variants()` - it needs to look up `cherry_tomatoes` key in `variants.yml` when query is "cherry tomatoes".

---

## How to Use This for Development

### 1. Make code changes

### 2. Run quick validation
```bash
./run_tests.sh quick
```

### 3. If issues found, debug with verbose
```bash
ALIGN_VERBOSE=1 ./run_tests.sh quick 2>&1 | grep -A30 "apple"
```

### 4. Run unit tests
```bash
./run_tests.sh unit
```

### 5. Run full batch test
```bash
./run_tests.sh 50batch
```

## Wrapper Script Path Fix (2025-10-29)

**Issue:** Initial wrapper script was looking for `nutritionverse-tests/entrypoints/run_first_50.sh` which didn't exist.

**Solution:** Updated to use correct path: `scripts/run_first_50.sh`

**Fix Applied:**
```bash
# run_tests.sh line 61-67
if [ ! -f "scripts/run_first_50.sh" ]; then
    echo "ERROR: run_first_50.sh not found"
    echo "Expected: $REPO_ROOT/scripts/run_first_50.sh"
    exit 1
fi

bash scripts/run_first_50.sh
```

---

## Pipeline DB Available Flag Fix (2025-10-29)

**Issue:** After fixing wrapper path, 50-batch test showed `[ADAPTER] DB Available: False` even though environment variables were set correctly.

**Root Cause:** `pipeline/run.py` injected FDC database and alignment engine into adapter, but never set `adapter.db_available = True` flag. The adapter initialization set `db_available = False` by default, and it was never updated after successful injection.

**Solution:** Added explicit flag setting in `pipeline/run.py` after injection:

```python
# pipeline/run.py lines 96-101
# Inject our configured engine
adapter.alignment_engine = alignment_engine

# P0: Mark DB as available after successful injection
adapter.db_available = True

# P0: Set config version for telemetry
adapter.config_version = cfg.config_version
adapter.config_fingerprint = cfg.config_fingerprint
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ 50-batch test now runs successfully with DB connection working

## Stage1c Telemetry Schema Fix (2025-10-29)

**Issue:** Pydantic validation error when Stage1c switches occurred:
```
ValidationError: 2 validation errors for TelemetryEvent
stage1c_switched.from_id
  Input should be a valid string [type=string_type, input_value=None, input_type=NoneType]
stage1c_switched.to_id
  Input should be a valid string [type=string_type, input_value=None, input_type=NoneType]
```

**Root Cause:**
- P0 implementation in `align_convert.py` produces telemetry with `from_id` and `to_id` fields
- Old schema in `pipeline/schemas.py` defined `stage1c_switched` as `Optional[Dict[str, str]]`
- Pydantic couldn't validate because IDs could be `None` (not strings)

**Solution:** Created proper Pydantic model for Stage1c switches:

```python
# pipeline/schemas.py
class Stage1cSwitch(BaseModel):
    """P0: Stage1c telemetry for raw-first preference switches."""
    from_name: str = Field(alias="from")  # Original candidate name
    to_name: str = Field(alias="to")  # Switched candidate name
    from_id: Optional[str] = None  # Original FDC ID
    to_id: Optional[str] = None  # Switched FDC ID

    class Config:
        populate_by_name = True  # Allow both "from" and "from_name"
```

Updated TelemetryEvent schema:
```python
stage1c_switched: Optional[Stage1cSwitch] = None
```

Updated validation in `pipeline/run.py` to construct Stage1cSwitch objects with proper ID conversion.

**Files Modified:**
- [pipeline/schemas.py](pipeline/schemas.py) - Added Stage1cSwitch model
- [pipeline/run.py](pipeline/run.py:202-224) - Updated validation logic

**Result:** ‚úÖ 50-batch test completes without Pydantic errors
